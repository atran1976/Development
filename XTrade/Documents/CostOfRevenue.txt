Description:
- Cost of Goods and Services (COGS), also known as Cost of Revenue or Cost of Sales, represents the direct costs incurred in producing goods or delivering services sold by a company.
- It represents the direct costs incurred to produce and deliver goods sold during the period.
Formula:
- COGS = Beginning Inventory + Purchases − Ending Inventory

Key Insights:
- Lower COGS = Higher Gross Margins: Industries like SaaS and pharmaceuticals maintain low COGS due to minimal incremental costs for additional sales.
- Higher COGS = Volume-Driven Margins: Industries like automotive and manufacturing rely on economies of scale to generate profits despite high COGS.
- Service-Based vs. Product-Based Industries: Services (e.g., software) typically have lower COGS compared to product-based industries (e.g., retail).

- Efficiency Indicator: Lower COGS% indicates higher efficiency and cost control in production.
- Inventory Management: Reflects the cost of inventory movement during the period, helping evaluate turnover efficiency.
- Tax Deductible Expense: COGS is tax-deductible, reducing taxable income.

Limitations:
- Industry Variations: High-tech and service-based businesses often have low COGS, while retail and manufacturing may have higher COGS due to material costs.
- Excludes Indirect Costs: Doesn’t account for marketing, administrative, or research expenses, limiting profitability insights.
- Inventory Valuation Impact: COGS is affected by inventory valuation methods like FIFO (First-In-First-Out) or LIFO (Last-In-First-Out).
- Seasonal Fluctuations: Businesses with seasonal sales cycles may have variable COGS, complicating comparisons.

Key Takeaway:
- COGS is critical for measuring production efficiency and calculating gross profit margins.
- Use it with operating expenses, net profit margins, and inventory turnover ratios for a complete profitability analysis.
