- represents revenue generated from the company’s core operations.

Formula:

Key Insights:

- Profitability Focus: Excludes non-operating income, providing a clearer picture of core profitability.
- Investor Confidence: Rising operating revenue often attracts investors, signaling healthy demand and business growth.

Limitations:
- Does Not Reflect Profitability: High operating revenue doesn’t always mean profitability if costs and expenses are also high.
- Ignores One-Time Gains: Excludes income from non-core activities, which may still affect overall profitability.
- Industry Dependence: Growth rates and margins vary significantly by industry, so comparisons must be made within sectors.
- Focuses Only on Sales: Does not account for debt, cash flow, or capital structure, which are critical for financial health.

Key Takeaway:
- Operating Revenue is a key indicator of a company’s financial performance and ability to generate income from core operations.
- Use it with Operating Margin, OPEX, and Net Income to assess efficiency and profitability.
