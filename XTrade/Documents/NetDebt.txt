Description:
- Net Debt is a financial metric that measures a company's total debt minus its cash and cash equivalents. It reflects the company's net financial obligations after accounting for liquid assets available to offset the debt.

Formula:
- Net Debt = Total Debt − Cash and Cash Equivalents

Interpretation:
- Positive Net Debt (> 0): The company has more debt than cash, indicating leverage dependency.
- Negative Net Debt (< 0): (Net Cash Position) The company has more cash than debt, signaling financial flexibility and low risk.

Key Insights:
- Debt Repayment Capacity: Tracks whether cash reserves can offset debt, reducing liquidity risks.
- Financial Flexibility: Negative net debt provides capital flexibility for investment or acquisitions.
- Risk Monitoring: High net debt relative to EBITDA or equity highlights financial vulnerability.
- Debt Dependency Trends: Rising net debt may indicate aggressive expansion or financial distress.

Advantages:
- Holistic View of Debt Position: Considers cash reserves, offering a realistic assessment of net obligations.
- Liquidity Focused: Highlights whether a company can cover debt using liquid assets.
- Debt Planning Tool: Supports capital structure optimization and debt refinancing decisions.

Limitations:
- Cash Volatility: High seasonal cash flows may temporarily understate net debt.
- Non-Operational Cash Excluded: Includes cash reserves regardless of whether they are earmarked for projects or acquisitions.
- Industry Variability: Capital-intensive industries naturally have higher net debt, making comparisons with asset-light industries unreliable.
- Doesn’t Reflect Interest Costs: Excludes debt servicing costs, requiring interest coverage analysis for deeper insights.

Key Takeaway:
- Net Debt measures a company’s debt obligations after accounting for cash reserves, offering a clearer picture of its financial leverage and liquidity.
- Combine with ratios like Net Debt-to-EBITDA, Net Debt-to-Equity, and Interest Coverage to assess financial stability and risk levels.
