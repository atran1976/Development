Description:
- It measures how efficiently a company is using its assets to generate profits. 

Formula:
- ROA =  (Net Income / Average Total Assets)

Interpretation:
- ROA = (200 / 1000) = 0.20 or 20%
- The company generates $0.20 of profit for every $1 of assets.

Key Insights:
- High ROA (> Industry Average): 
	Indicates efficient use of assets to generate profits.
	Common in asset-light industries like technology.
- Low ROA (< Industry Average):
	May reflect poor asset utilization or capital inefficiencies.
	Often seen in capital-intensive industries like utilities and real estate.
- Negative ROA:
	Signals losses and may indicate operational inefficiencies or financial distress.

Limitations:
- Ignores Leverage (Debt): Doesn’t account for how assets are financed (e.g., debt vs. equity).
- Non-Cash Distortions: Includes depreciation and amortization, which can understate profitability for asset-heavy industries.
- One-Time Items Impact: Asset sales or write-offs can distort ROA, providing misleading results.

Key Takeaway:
- ROA measures how efficiently a company uses its assets to generate profits and is crucial for evaluating operational performance.
- Combine ROA with ROE, ROCE, and Debt Ratios for a complete financial analysis.
