Description:
- The Quick Ratio measures a company's ability to meet its short-term liabilities using its most liquid assets, excluding inventory. 

Formula:
- Quick Ratio = (CurrentAssets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities

Interpretation:
- Quick Ratio = (40 + 50) / 90 = 0.9
- Company has $0.90 in quick assets for every $1.00 of liabilities.

Key Insights:
- Quick Ratio > 1 (Healthy): The company can immediately cover its short-term liabilities without relying on inventory sales.
- Quick Ratio < 1 (Risky): The company might struggle to meet short-term obligations without selling inventory or other assets.
- Quick Ratio = 1 (Adequate): Indicates balanced liquidity, but limited buffer for unexpected expenses.

- Liquidity Evaluation: A quick ratio > 1.0 suggests the company has sufficient liquid assets to handle short-term liabilities without relying on inventory sales.
- Inventory-Independent Analysis: Ideal for businesses where inventory turnover is slow (e.g., manufacturing) or highly volatile.
- Short-Term Cash Flow Management: Companies with low quick ratios may face cash flow challenges and require external financing.
- Industry-Specific Variations: Some industries (e.g., retail) rely heavily on inventory, making a lower quick ratio more acceptable.

Advantages:
- Strict Liquidity Test: Focuses on highly liquid assets, providing a realistic measure of short-term solvency.
- Independent of Inventory Valuation: Avoids issues related to inventory valuation methods (e.g., FIFO vs LIFO).
- Cash Flow Indicator: Highlights immediate liquidity to address emergencies or unexpected obligations.

Limitations: 
- Excludes Inventory Value: May underestimate liquidity for businesses with fast-moving inventory (e.g., retail).
- Ignores Debt Repayments: Doesn’t account for timing or size of upcoming debt repayments.
- Seasonality Impact: Ratios may fluctuate due to seasonal variations in cash flow and receivables.
- Industry Variations: Some industries naturally maintain low quick ratios due to reliance on inventory sales.

Key Takeaway:
- The Quick Ratio evaluates short-term liquidity without relying on inventory, offering a conservative view of a company’s ability to meet obligations.
- Use it alongside Current Ratio and Cash Ratio for a comprehensive liquidity analysis.
