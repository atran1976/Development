Description:
- P/S Ratio (Price-to-Sales Ratio) is a valuation metric that compares a company's market capitalization to its revenue. 
- It measures how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of sales generated by the company.

Formula:
- P/SRatio = Market Capitalization / Total Revenue

Example:
- P/SRatio = (50/10) = 5
- Investors are paying $5 for every $1 in Revenue.

Interpretation:
- P/S < 1 – Stock may be undervalued.
- P/S between 1–2 – Stock is typically fairly valued.
- P/S > 2 – Stock may be overvalued, depending on growth prospects.

- High P/S Ratio (> Industry Average): Investors expect high growth or future profitability, but it may indicate overvaluation.
- Low P/S Ratio (< Industry Average):Could signal a bargain stock or reflect weak growth prospects.

- Revenue Focused: Useful for unprofitable companies (e.g., startups) where earnings metrics like P/E are not applicable.
- Less Manipulated: Revenue is harder to manipulate than earnings, making P/S ratios more reliable.
- Growth Stock Analysis: Suitable for industries like technology and biotech, where profits are often delayed due to high R&D costs.

Limitations:
- Ignores Profitability: Revenue doesn’t account for costs or margins, so low-profit businesses may appear undervalued.
- Industry Variations: Different industries have varying sales models, making cross-industry comparisons unreliable.
- Debt and Expenses Ignored: High debt or operating costs are not reflected, which may affect sustainability.
- Growth Expectations Missing: Unlike PEG, P/S does not include growth rates, so it may not reflect future potential.

Key Takeaway:
- Use P/S ratios alongside other metrics like P/E, PEG, ROE, and gross margins to evaluate a company’s valuation and profitability potential.
- It’s particularly useful for analyzing early-stage growth companies and industries where earnings volatility is common.
