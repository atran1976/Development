Description:
- EV/EBITDA (Enterprise Value to Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization) is a widely used valuation multiple that compares a company's total value (EV) to its EBITDA.

Formula:
- EV-To-EBITDA = Enterprise Value / EBITDA

Interpretation:
- EV/EBITDA = 550 / 50 = 11
​- The company is valued at 11 times its EBITDA.
- The company's enterprise value (EV) is $11 For every $1 of EBITDA.

Key Insights:
- EV/EBITDA < 10: Company may be undervalued relative to peers.
- EV/EBITDA between 10–15: Company is typically fairly valued.
- EV/EBITDA > 15: Company may be overvalued, or investors expect high growth potential.

- Low EV/EBITDA (< Industry Average) 
	May indicate the company is undervalued or facing financial difficulties.
	Could also mean low growth potential.
- High EV/EBITDA (> Industry Average):
	Suggests overvaluation or reflects high growth expectations.
	Common in high-growth industries like technology.

- Capital Structure Neutral: Incorporates debt and cash, making it useful for comparing highly leveraged and debt-free companies.
- Cash Flow Proxy: Focuses on operating profitability before non-operating costs (e.g., taxes and interest).
- Cross-Industry Comparison: Suitable for industries with capital-intensive structures, such as energy, utilities, and real estate.
- Acquisition Tool: Frequently used in mergers and acquisitions (M&A) to determine valuation multiples.

Limitations:
- Ignores CapEx: EBITDA excludes capital expenditures, which can be significant for industries like manufacturing and energy.
- Non-Cash Adjustments: Depreciation and amortization are excluded, potentially overstating profitability for asset-heavy businesses.
- Debt and Risk Unaccounted: While debt is factored into EV, it doesn’t consider the risk associated with high debt levels.
- Growth Not Considered: Unlike the PEG ratio, EV/EBITDA ignores growth rates, which are critical for growth stocks.

Key Takeaway:
- The EV/EBITDA ratio is useful for comparing companies with different capital structures and is widely applied in M&A valuations.
- Combine it with other metrics like P/E, P/S, and ROCE for a comprehensive analysis of value, profitability, and growth.
