Description:
- Retention Ratio measures the proportion of a company’s earnings that is retained rather than distributed to shareholders as dividends. 
- It indicates the percentage of net income that is reinvested in the business or held as reserves.
- it reflects the portion of profits retained for growth or debt repayment (Higher is better)

Formula:
- Retention Ratio = 1 − Payout Ratio

Interpretation:
- Retention Ratio= 1− 0.30 = 0.70or 70%
- The company retains 70% of its net income for reinvestment or reserves and distributes the remaining 30% as dividends.

Key Insights:
- High Retention Ratio (>50%): (Growth-Oriented Strategy): Indicates the company prioritizes reinvestment in growth, R&D, or debt reduction over dividend payouts.
- Low Retention Ratio (<50%): (Income-Oriented Strategy): Suggests the company focuses on returning a significant portion of earnings to shareholders, typical of mature or stable companies.

- Growth Indicator: The retention ratio shows the company’s focus on reinvesting earnings for growth or paying down debt.
- Dividend Policy Insight: Complements the payout ratio by highlighting how much of the earnings are kept within the company.
- Company Growth Stage: 
	High retention ratios are common in growth-stage companies that need to reinvest heavily.
	Mature companies often have lower retention ratios due to steady cash flows and a focus on dividends.
- Dividend Policy: The ratio reflects the company’s dividend policy and its approach to shareholder returns versus internal growth.
- Reinvestment Potential: A higher retention ratio suggests greater internal resources available for expansion, acquisitions, or innovation.

Advantages:
- Growth Potential Indicator: Highlights the company’s focus on future growth and reinvestment.
- Dividend Strategy Insight: Complements the payout ratio, offering a complete picture of earnings allocation.
- Liquidity and Stability: Higher retention ratios can indicate a company’s ability to fund operations and debt obligations internally.

Limitations:
- Does Not Guarantee Growth: Retained earnings may not always lead to profitable reinvestment or expansion.
- Industry Variability: Benchmarks vary significantly across industries, limiting the usefulness of cross-sector comparisons.
- Short-Term Focus: The ratio reflects earnings for a specific period, which may not capture long-term reinvestment strategies.

Key Takeaway:
- 1 - Payout Ratio (Retention Ratio) highlights the percentage of earnings retained for reinvestment or reserves, making it a key metric for evaluating growth potential and financial strategy.
- A higher ratio (>50%) suggests a growth-oriented approach, while a lower ratio (<50%) reflects a focus on shareholder returns through dividends.
- Combine with profitability, reinvestment, and growth metrics for a complete financial analysis.
