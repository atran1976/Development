Description:
- It measures the profitability of a company's core business activities. 
- It provides insights into the efficiency of production processes, pricing power, and overall profitability before considering other operating expenses.

Formula:
- Gross Profit Margin = (GrossProfit / TotalRevenue) 

Interpretation:
- Gross Profit Margin = (200 / 500) = 0.40 or 40%
- The company retains 40 cents for every $1 of revenue after covering direct costs.

Key Insights:
- High Gross Profit Margin (> Industry Average):
	Indicates efficient production and pricing power.
	Reflects cost control and the ability to command premium prices.
- Low Gross Profit Margin (< Industry Average):
	Suggests higher production costs or pricing pressure.
	May indicate inefficiencies or competitive weaknesses.

Limitations:
- Excludes Operating Costs: Doesn’t account for operating expenses, such as salaries, rent, or marketing costs.
- Industry Dependence: Varies significantly by industry, so cross-sector comparisons may be misleading.
- Inventory Impact: Inventory valuation methods (e.g., FIFO vs. LIFO) can distort COGS and affect margins.
- Short-Term Focus: May overlook long-term trends and focus only on current profitability.

Key Takeaway:
- Gross Profit Margin is ideal for evaluating production efficiency and cost control.
- Combine it with Operating Margin, Net Profit Margin, and EBITDA for a complete profitability analysis.
