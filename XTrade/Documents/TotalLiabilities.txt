Description:
- Total Liabilities represent the sum of all debts and obligations a company owes to external parties, such as creditors, suppliers, and lenders.

Formula:
- Total Liabilities = Total Assets − Equity or Current Liabilities + Non-Current Liabilities

Key Insights:
- Financial Risk Analysis: High liabilities indicate leverage, which can amplify returns but increase financial risk.
- Liquidity vs. Solvency: Current liabilities assess short-term liquidity, while non-current liabilities focus on long-term solvency.
- Growth Strategy: Rising liabilities can signal growth investments or expansion efforts, especially in capital-intensive industries.
- Debt Sustainability: Use Interest Coverage Ratio to check if earnings can cover interest expenses comfortably:

Limitations:
- Asset and Debt Quality: Doesn’t account for quality of assets backing the liabilities.
- Off-Balance Sheet Liabilities: May exclude contingent liabilities or lease obligations not reflected on the balance sheet.
- Timing Mismatch: Maturity schedules for current vs. long-term liabilities are ignored—liquidity crunches may occur despite low overall debt.

Key Takeaway:
- Total Liabilities measure a company’s debt obligations and are crucial for analyzing financial risk and solvency.
- Combine with ratios like Debt-to-Equity, Current Ratio, and Interest Coverage for a comprehensive analysis of financial health.
