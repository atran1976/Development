Description:
- The Cash Ratio is the most conservative liquidity ratio that measures a company’s ability to pay off its short-term liabilities using only its cash and cash equivalents. It excludes all other assets, making it a stringent measure of liquidity.

Formula:
- Cash Ratio = Cash and Cash Equivalents / Current Liabilities

Example:
- Cash Ratio = 70/100 = 0.70
- The company has $0.70 in cash for every $1 of short-term obligation (current liabilities)

Key Insights:
- Cash Ratio > 1: The company can fully cover its short-term obligations using cash alone.
- Cash Ratio = 1: The company can cover exact liabilities with available cash, but has no buffer for unexpected expenses.
- Cash Ratio < 1: The company may need to rely on accounts receivable, inventory, or external financing to pay liabilities.

- Liquidity Stress Test: A cash ratio < 1.0 highlights reliance on non-cash assets or external financing to pay liabilities.
- Financial Cushion Indicator: Companies with high cash ratios may be too conservative, missing out on growth opportunities.
- Industry-Specific Trends: Asset-heavy industries (e.g., utilities, manufacturing) naturally have lower cash ratios.
- Risk Analysis: Low cash ratios may raise default risks in economic downturns.

Advantages:
- Strict Liquidity Focus: Evaluates only the most liquid assets, providing a worst-case scenario view of solvency.
- Risk Management Tool: Helps identify cash flow issues and debt repayment risks early.
- Investor and Creditor Confidence: High cash ratios signal financial stability and may improve creditworthiness.

Limitations:
- Ignores Receivables and Inventory: Excludes assets that may be quickly converted to cash, underestimating liquidity.
- Excess Cash Concerns: High ratios may indicate underutilized capital, leading to lower returns.
- Industry Variability: Certain industries operate effectively with low cash reserves due to reliable cash flows.
- No Profitability Measure: Focuses solely on liquidity, ignoring operational performance and profitability.

Key Takeaway:
- The Cash Ratio is a strict measure of liquidity, focusing only on cash and equivalents to test whether a company can meet short-term obligations without selling inventory or relying on receivables.
- Combine it with metrics like Current Ratio and Quick Ratio for a comprehensive liquidity analysis.
