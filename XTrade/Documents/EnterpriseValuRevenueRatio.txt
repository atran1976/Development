Description:
- EV/Revenue (Enterprise Value-to-Revenue) is a valuation multiple that compares a company's total enterprise value (EV) to its revenue. 
- It measures how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of revenue generated by the company.

Formula:
- EV-To- Revenue=  Enterprise Value / Revenue

Interpertation:
- EV/Revenue = (550 / 200) = 2.75
- Investors are paying $2.75 for every $1 of revenue

Key Insights:
- EV/Revenue < 1: Company may be undervalued, but it could also indicate low profitability or financial distress.
- EV/Revenue between 1–3: Indicates the company is typically fairly valued.
- EV/Revenue > 3: Suggests the company may be overvalued or is expected to generate high future growth.

- High EV/Revenue (> Industry Average): 
	Investors expect high growth and future profitability.
	May indicate overvaluation if growth prospects fail to justify the premium.
- Low EV/Revenue (< Industry Average):
	May suggest undervaluation or poor growth potential.
	Could also reflect cyclical performance or temporary issues.

- Focus on Sales: Useful for early-stage companies with low or negative earnings where P/E ratios cannot be applied.
- Debt Neutral: Incorporates debt and cash through Enterprise Value, giving a capital structure-neutral valuation.
- Cross-Industry Comparison: Suitable for comparing companies in different industries, especially where profit margins vary significantly.

Limitations:
- Ignores Profitability: EV/Revenue does not consider expenses or profit margins, so a high ratio doesn’t guarantee profitability.
- Debt and Cash Variations: Companies with high debt may appear overvalued, while cash-heavy companies may seem undervalued.
- Industry Sensitivity: Industries with low margins (e.g., retail or energy) naturally have lower ratios, so comparisons must be industry-specific.
- Growth Rates Not Considered: Unlike PEG ratios, EV/Revenue does not adjust for growth expectations.

Key Takeaway:
- EV/Revenue is ideal for valuing companies with negative earnings or volatile profitability, particularly in growth sectors.
- Use it along with EV/EBITDA, P/S, and P/E ratios to assess valuation comprehensively.
