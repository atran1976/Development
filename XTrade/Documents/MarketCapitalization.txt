Large Cap: 
Companies with a market capitalization typically greater than $10 billion. These are generally well-established companies with stable operations and significant market presence.

Mid Cap: 
Companies with a market capitalization typically between $2 billion and $10 billion. Mid-cap companies are often considered to have growth potential but may carry higher risk than large-cap companies.

Small Cap: 
Companies with a market capitalization typically below $2 billion. Small-cap companies are often newer or less-established firms with higher growth potential but also higher risk.
