Description:
- The Working Capital Turnover Ratio measures how efficiently a company uses its working capital (current assets minus current liabilities) to generate revenue. 
- It evaluates operational efficiency by showing how many times the company can turn its working capital into sales over a given period.

Formula:
- Working Capital Turnover = Revenue / Average Working Capital

Interpretation:
- Working Capital Turnover = 2000 / 315 = 6.35
- The company generates $6.35 in revenue for every $1 of working capital.

Key Insights:
- High Ratio (> 6): (Highly Efficient): The company effectively uses working capital to generate revenue. Indicates strong liquidity management and fast turnover of resources.
- Moderate Ratio (3–6): (Reasonable Efficiency): Reflects balanced operations, common in capital-intensive industries.
- Low Ratio (< 3): (Inefficient Use): Suggests underutilization of resources, overstocked inventory, or poor receivables management.
- Negative Ratio: (Liquidity Problem): Occurs when working capital is negative, indicating short-term liquidity stress or over-reliance on liabilities.

- Liquidity and Efficiency Balance: High ratios highlight strong cash management, while low ratios may signal overinvestment in receivables or inventory.
- Growth vs Utilization: Companies with high turnover can support revenue growth without heavy reliance on additional assets.
- Debt Dependency Monitoring: Low ratios may require short-term borrowing to fund operations, increasing financial risk.
- Operational Performance Testing: Tracks whether the company’s working capital cycle aligns with its growth strategies and liquidity needs.

Advantages:
- Efficiency Focus: Highlights whether the company is effectively managing working capital resources to generate sales.
- Liquidity Monitoring Tool: Tracks short-term liquidity trends, especially useful for seasonal businesses.
- Scalability Analysis: Evaluates whether the company can support growth without requiring significant asset additions.

Limitations:
- Ignores Profitability: Focuses on sales efficiency, not whether those sales are profitable. (Combine with profit margins.)
- Seasonal Fluctuations: May be distorted in businesses with seasonal revenue patterns—requires quarterly adjustments.
- Negative Working Capital Distortion: Companies with negative working capital (e.g., retailers) may show inflated ratios that are misleading. (Combine with cash flow metrics.)
- Industry Sensitivity: Asset-heavy industries naturally show lower ratios, requiring peer comparisons rather than cross-sector benchmarks.

Key Takeaway:
- The Working Capital Turnover Ratio evaluates operational efficiency by measuring how well a company uses short-term assets and liabilities to generate revenue.
- Combine it with liquidity ratios, cash flow metrics, and profitability measures for a comprehensive financial analysis.
