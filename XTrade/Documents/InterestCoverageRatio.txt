Description:
- The Interest Coverage Ratio measures a company’s ability to pay interest expenses on its outstanding debt using its earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT).

Formula:
- Interest Coverage Ratio = Ebit / InterestExpense

Interpretation:
- Interest Coverage Ratio = 200 / 4 = 5.0
- The company can cover its interest payments 5 times using its earning

Key Insights:
- High Ratio (> 3.0): (Strong Solvency): The company generates ample earnings to cover its interest payments, signaling low risk and financial flexibility.
- Moderate Ratio (1.5–3.0): (Manageable Risk): Earnings can cover interest obligations, but the company may face pressure during economic downturns or cash flow disruptions.
- Low Ratio (< 1.5): (High Risk): Earnings are insufficient to cover interest payments, indicating financial stress and potential liquidity issues.
- Negative Ratio (< 0): (Operating Losses): Occurs if EBIT is negative, meaning the company is losing money and cannot service its debt without additional financing.

- Debt Servicing Ability: High ratios indicate strong ability to cover interest payments, reducing default risk.
- Operational Efficiency Check: Low ratios may highlight profitability issues or excessive debt burdens.
- Risk Sensitivity Assessment: Companies with low ratios are vulnerable to interest rate hikes or profit declines.
- Capital Structure Balance: High coverage suggests room for growth, while low coverage may require debt restructuring.

Advantages:
- Debt Sustainability Focus: Evaluates whether a company generates enough earnings to service debt comfortably.
- Investor and Creditor Confidence: High ratios enhance creditworthiness, reducing borrowing costs and investor risk perception.
- Liquidity Analysis Tool: Helps identify potential cash flow issues and the need for debt management strategies.

Limitations:
- Excludes Principal Repayments: Focuses only on interest payments, ignoring loan principal repayments that impact cash flow. (Combine with debt-to-EBITDA for full analysis.)
- EBIT Focus May Overstate Earnings: EBIT excludes taxes and non-operating expenses, which can affect actual cash flow available for payments. (Cash Coverage Ratio addresses this.)
- Industry Variability: Capital-intensive sectors operate with lower ratios, while service-based industries often have higher ratios.
- No Growth or Profitability Context: Doesn’t assess whether earnings are sustainable or growing, requiring supplementary analysis with profitability metrics like ROE.

Key Takeaway:
- The Interest Coverage Ratio evaluates whether a company’s earnings can cover interest payments, offering insights into debt sustainability and solvency risk.
- Use it with Net Debt-to-EBITDA, Debt-to-Equity, and Cash Coverage Ratios for a comprehensive leverage and liquidity analysis.
