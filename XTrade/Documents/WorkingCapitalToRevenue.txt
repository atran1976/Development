Description:
- Working Capital / Total Revenue ratio measures the proportion of a company’s working capital relative to its total revenue. 
- It indicates the company’s ability to use its short-term resources to support its revenue generation and assess its operational efficiency.

Formula:
- Working Capital / Total Revenue

Interpretation:
- Working Capital / Total Revenue = 200 / 1000 = 0.20 or 20%
- The company’s working capital is 20% of its total revenue.
- The company generates $1 of revenue for every $0.20 working capital.

Key Insights:
- Higher Ratio (>30%): (High Liquidity, Potential Inefficiency): Indicates strong liquidity, but may also suggest inefficient use of working capital if excessive resources are tied up in current assets.
- Moderate Ratio (10–30%): (Balanced Efficiency): Reflects an efficient balance between working capital and revenue generation.
- Low Ratio (<10%): (Low Liquidity, Potential Risk): Suggests limited working capital, which may indicate liquidity challenges or tight cash management

- Liquidity Indicator: Evaluates whether the company’s short-term resources are sufficient to support its revenue generation.
- Operational Efficiency: Indicates how effectively working capital is utilized in driving revenue.

- Liquidity Assessment: A higher ratio indicates the company has a larger cushion of current assets relative to liabilities to support revenue generation.
- Efficiency Indicator: A very high ratio may signal inefficient use of working capital (e.g., excess inventory or receivables).
- Industry Sensitivity: Asset-light industries like tech often have lower ratios due to minimal inventory and receivables.
- Capital-intensive industries like manufacturing tend to have higher ratios due to higher inventory and receivables.

Advantages:
- Short-Term Resource Analysis: Highlights how well a company’s short-term assets and liabilities are aligned with revenue generation.
- Operational Efficiency Indicator: Reflects whether working capital is being effectively utilized to support operations.
- Industry Comparisons: Useful for benchmarking working capital efficiency across similar companies.

Limitations:
- Industry Variations: Ratios differ significantly across industries, making cross-sector comparisons less meaningful.
- Doesn’t Measure Profitability: A high ratio does not necessarily indicate profitability or cost-effectiveness.
- Short-Term Fluctuations: Seasonal changes or one-time events can distort the ratio, requiring longer-term analysis.

Key Takeaway:
- Working Capital / Total Revenue assesses the relationship between short-term resources and revenue generation, highlighting liquidity and efficiency.
- A moderate ratio (10–30%) indicates balanced liquidity and efficient working capital usage.
- Combine this ratio with profitability and efficiency metrics for a comprehensive financial analysis.
