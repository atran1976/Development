Description:
- It evaluates whether the company generates enough cash flow to handle its current liabilities without relying on external financing or asset sales.

Formula:
- Operating Cash Flow to Current Debt Ratio = (Operating Cash Flow / Current Debt)
​
Interpretation:
- OCF To Current Debt Ratio = (150 / 100) = 1.5 or 150%
- The company generates $1.5 in cash flow (OCF) for every $1 of current debt.
- The company can cover 150% of its current debt using cash from operations, indicating strong liquidity.

Key Insights:
- Ratio > 1.0 or 100%: (Healthy Liquidity): The company generates sufficient cash flow to cover its short-term debt obligations.
- Ratio < 1.0 or 100%: (Liquidity Concerns): The company may face cash flow shortages and could require external funding or asset sales to cover its short-term debt.
- Higher Ratios (> 2.0 or 200%): (Excellent Financial Health): Suggests strong cash flow generation, providing flexibility for growth investments or debt reduction.

- Liquidity Risk Monitoring: Low ratios suggest cash flow issues and potential liquidity risks, especially during economic downturns.
- Debt Servicing Ability: High ratios highlight a company’s ability to repay short-term obligations without needing external financing.
- Growth vs Stability: Companies with higher ratios may use excess cash for investment opportunities or debt reduction.
- Cash Flow Dependency: For businesses with volatile cash flows, low ratios may highlight reliance on alternative funding sources.

Advantages:
- Real Cash Measurement: Focuses on actual cash generation rather than accounting profits.
- Short-Term Solvency Focus: Measures the company’s ability to handle immediate obligations without relying on inventory sales.
- Debt and Liquidity Planning: Useful for assessing debt repayment strategies and identifying cash flow gaps.

Limitations:
- Excludes Long-Term Debt: Focuses only on current debt, ignoring long-term obligations that may impact solvency.
- Cash Flow Volatility: Cash flows may fluctuate seasonally, leading to inconsistent results.
- Industry Variability: Different industries have varying capital structures, affecting benchmarks and comparisons.
- Timing Issues: Doesn’t reflect timing mismatches between cash inflows and debt repayments.

Key Takeaway:
- The Operating Cash Flow to Current Debt Ratio measures whether a company can pay short-term debt using cash generated from operations, offering insight into liquidity strength and solvency risks.
- Use it alongside Cash Flow Coverage Ratio, Current Ratio, and Quick Ratio for a comprehensive liquidity analysis.
