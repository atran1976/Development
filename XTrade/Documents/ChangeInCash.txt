Description:
- Change in Cash measures the net increase or decrease in a company’s cash and cash equivalents over a specific accounting period. 
- It reflects the net cash flow from operating, investing, and financing activities, providing insights into how a company manages its liquidity and capital resources.
- (Also known as Net Change in Cash or Change in Cash and Cash Equivalents)

Formula:
- Change in Cash= Ending Cash Balance − Beginning Cash Balance
			or
- Change in Cash=Operating Cash Flow + Investing Cash Flow+Financing Cash Flow

Interpretation:
- Change in Cash=40,000
- The company experienced a net increase of $40,000 in cash during the period.

Key Insights:
- Positive Change in Cash (> 0): (Cash Inflow Surplus)
	Indicates the company generated more cash than it spent during the period.
	Often reflects profitable operations, asset sales, or capital raises. (Monitor cash efficiency.)
- Negative Change in Cash (< 0): (Cash Outflow Deficit)
	Indicates the company spent more cash than it generated.
	May signal growth-focused investments, debt repayments, or liquidity challenges. (Analyze free cash flow.)

- Liquidity Analysis: Positive cash changes suggest strong liquidity, supporting debt repayment, dividends, and expansion. (Monitor sustainability.)
- Growth vs Stability Focus: Negative cash changes may signal investment in growth (e.g., CapEx) but could lead to liquidity concerns if sustained. (Analyze OCF and FCF.)
- Debt Financing vs Equity Raising: Positive cash from financing activities (e.g., debt issuance) can fund growth, but high reliance on financing may increase leverage risks. (Monitor D/E ratios.)
- Cash Management Efficiency: Use the cash conversion cycle (CCC) to assess how quickly cash moves through operations, collections, and payments. (Lower values indicate better efficiency.)

Advantages:
- Liquidity Tracking Tool: Highlights whether cash is building up or being utilized effectively for growth or operations.
- Cash Flow Source Analysis: Shows whether cash changes are driven by operations, investments, or financing activities. (Monitor trends.)
- Debt and Dividend Planning: Evaluates whether the company generates enough cash for repayments, dividends, and buybacks. (Monitor payout ratios.)

Limitations:
- No Profitability Insight: Positive cash flows may arise from asset sales or debt financing, not necessarily from profitable operations. (Combine with net income and margins.)
- Short-Term Focus: Reflects only current cash movements, providing no insights into long-term growth potential. (Analyze FCF and ROI.)
- Industry-Specific Patterns: Certain industries naturally show negative cash flows (e.g., tech) due to growth investments, while others prioritize cash stability (e.g., retail). (Benchmark carefully.)
- Non-Recurring Activities Impact: May be distorted by one-time events like asset sales or debt issuance, requiring adjusted analysis. (Monitor trends over time.)

Key Takeaway:
- Change in Cash measures whether a company’s cash position has increased or decreased during a specific period, reflecting liquidity trends, capital structure, and cash flow efficiency.
- Combine it with operating cash flow, free cash flow, and leverage ratios for a comprehensive financial assessment.
