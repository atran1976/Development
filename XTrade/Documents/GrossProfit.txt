Description:
- Gross Profit is the profit a company makes after deducting the cost of goods sold (COGS) or cost of services from its total revenue. 
- It measures how efficiently a company produces and sells its products or services.

Formula:
- Gross Profit = Total Revenue − Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)

Key Insights:
- Profitability Indicator: High gross profit indicates efficient production and pricing power.
- Cost Control: Lower COGS relative to revenue reflects better cost control and higher margins.
- Growth Measurement: Rising gross profit over time suggests scalable operations and growth potential.

- Focuses on Core Operations: Reflects profitability from primary activities without distractions from non-operating costs.
- Helps Pricing Decisions: Tracks the impact of pricing strategies and production efficiencies.
- Identifies Cost Issues: Declining gross profit margins can highlight cost inefficiencies or competitive pricing pressures.

Limitations:
- Excludes Operating Costs: Doesn’t account for salaries, rent, or marketing expenses, which affect overall profitability.
- Ignores Debt and Interest Costs: Doesn’t consider capital structure, making it incomplete for financial risk analysis.
- Industry Dependence: Gross profit margins vary widely by industry, limiting cross-sector comparisons.
- Inventory Valuation Impact: Sensitive to inventory accounting methods (e.g., FIFO vs. LIFO).

Key Takeaway:
- Gross Profit measures core profitability and is critical for evaluating production efficiency.
- Use it alongside Operating Income, Net Profit Margin, and ROE to assess overall financial performance
