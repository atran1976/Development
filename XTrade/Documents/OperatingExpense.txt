Description:
- Operating Expenses (OPEX) are the day-to-day costs required to run a business and support its core operations. 
- These expenses are not directly tied to production but are essential for maintaining and growing the business.

Formula:
Operating Expenses (OPEX) = Total Expenses − (COGS + Non-Operating Expenses)

Limitations:
- Growth vs. Inefficiency: High OPEX may reflect growth investments, making it hard to distinguish from inefficiency.
- Industry Differences: Benchmarks vary widely across industries, so comparisons must be industry-specific.
- Excludes Financing Costs: OPEX ignores interest payments and capital expenditures, which can affect profitability.
- Not Profitability-Focused: High spending in areas like R&D may reduce profitability in the short term but drive long-term growth.

Key Takeaway:
- OPEX evaluates operational efficiency and is vital for analyzing a company's cost structure and scalability.
- Combine OPEX with Operating Margin, EBITDA, and Net Profit Margin for a holistic financial analysis.
