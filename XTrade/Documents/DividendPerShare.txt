Description"
- DPS shows the amount of dividends a company pays out per share of its stock over a specific period, typically annually.

Formula:
- DPS =  Total Dividends Paid / Total Number of Outstanding Shares

Interpretation:
- DPS = (10 / 5) = 2
- Each shareholder receives $2.00 per share.

Key Insights:
- Higher DPS: Indicates strong financial performance and willingness to distribute profits. High DPS must be evaluated with payout ratio and earnings stability to ensure sustainability.
- Lower DPS: May imply the company is reinvesting profits for growth or has cash flow constraints.
- No DPS: Some growth-focused companies (e.g., tech firms) often do not pay dividends, preferring to reinvest earnings.

Limitations:
- No Growth Insight: High DPS may limit growth opportunities as retained earnings are reduced.
- Cyclical Risks: Companies may cut dividends during economic downturns, reducing income stability.
- Industry Differences: Capital-intensive sectors (e.g., utilities) naturally pay higher dividends, making comparisons across industries unreliable.
- Debt Financing Risk: Companies may borrow to pay dividends, which could be unsustainable in the long term.

Key Takeaway:
- DPS is a critical measure of profit distribution, especially for dividend-focused investors.
- Combine it with metrics like Dividend Yield, Payout Ratio, and EPS Growth to assess financial health and sustainability.
