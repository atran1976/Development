Description:
- Inventory represents the raw materials, work-in-progress (WIP), and finished goods a company holds for production or sale.
- It is expected to be sold or converted into cash within one year.

Formula:
- Inventory=Beginning Inventory+Purchases−Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)

Key Insights:
- Liquidity Assessment: Inventory is a current asset but may not be as liquid as cash or receivables.
- Sales Efficiency: High turnover or low DIO reflects strong demand and efficient inventory management.
- Obsolescence Risk: Slow-moving inventory may lead to write-offs and reduced profitability.
- Operational Efficiency: Excessive inventory ties up capital, while insufficient inventory risks stockouts and lost sales.

Limitations:
- Obsolescence Risk: Excess inventory may become unsellable, especially in industries with fast-changing trends (e.g., technology).
- Holding Costs: Storage, insurance, and handling costs may erode profit margins.
- Misvaluation: Differences in valuation methods (FIFO vs LIFO) affect reported inventory values and profitability.
- Liquidity Challenges: Inventory may take longer to liquidate, especially in slow markets.

Key Takeaway:
- Inventory is a current asset critical for revenue generation and operational efficiency.
- Use metrics like Inventory Turnover Ratio and Days Inventory Outstanding (DIO) to evaluate inventory performance and liquidity.
