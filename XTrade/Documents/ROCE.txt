Description:
- ROCE (Return on Capital Employed) is a profitability ratio that measures how efficiently a company generates profits from its capital employed. 
- It evaluates how well a company utilizes both equity and debt to produce operating income.
- Address the question - Does the company earn enough?

Formula:
- ROCE = (Ebit / (TotalAssets - CurrentLiabilities)) * 100

Interpertation:
- ROCE = (500,000 / 1,500,000) = 0.33 or 33.33%
- The company generates $0.33 of profit in every $1.00 of capital employed.

Key Insights:
- A higher ROCE means the company uses its capital efficiently to generate profits. 
- A lower ROCE may signal inefficient use of capital or over-investment in assets.
- When ROCE > ROE, it signifies that a company has little/no debt.
- A narrower discrepancy between ROCE and ROE is preferable. Warrent Buffet prefers ROCE >= 20%

- It considers both equity and debt, offering a more holistic view of profitability.
- Evaluates sustainable profitability rather than short-term gains.

Limitations:
- Works well for asset-heavy industries but may underrepresent technology or service-based companies with fewer physical assets.
- Large capital investments or asset sales in a given year can distort results.
- Ignores Tax and Debt Costs: Focuses on operating profit, not accounting for actual net earnings.
- Asset Valuation Issues: Assets are recorded at historical cost, so companies with older assets may have artificially higher ROCE.
- Short-Term Focus: May overestimate profitability during periods of low investment and underestimate it during expansion phases.

Key Takeaways:
- Ignores Future Growth: Focuses on current performance without considering growth prospects.
- Accounting Adjustments Impact: Dependent on accounting methods (e.g., depreciation policies), which may distort comparisons.
- Capital-Intensive Bias: Works best for capital-heavy industries but may not suit service-based businesses.
- Non-Operating Profits Excluded: Does not account for non-operating income, which might affect actual returns.
