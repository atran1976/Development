Description:
- It measures the proportion of total assets that are available as working capital, indicating a company's short-term liquidity position relative to its total assets.
- It evaluates the company’s ability to fund operations and short-term obligations using its current assets.

Formula:
- Working Capital to Total Assets Ratio =  (Working Capital / Total Assets)

​Interpretation:
- Working Capital to Total Assets Ratio =  (100 / 1000) = 0.10 or 10%
- The company has $0.10 of working capital for every $1 of total assets

Key Insights:
- High Ratio (> 20%): (Strong Liquidity): Indicates the company has ample working capital relative to its assets and can meet short-term obligations easily.
- Low Ratio (< 10%): (Liquidity Risk): Suggests the company may have limited liquidity and might struggle to fund daily operations or short-term debts.
- Negative Ratio (< 0%): (Financial Distress): Signals negative working capital, implying reliance on external financing to sustain operations.

- Liquidity Indicator: Higher ratios reflect better liquidity, allowing flexibility to handle expenses and investments.
- Operational Flexibility: Companies with higher working capital reserves can fund growth without relying heavily on debt.
- Financial Risk Assessment: A low or negative ratio may signal potential liquidity issues and cash flow constraints.
- Industry Variations: Capital-intensive industries (e.g., utilities) naturally have lower ratios due to fixed asset investments.

Advantages:
- Liquidity Measurement: Provides a snapshot of the company’s ability to cover short-term obligations with existing resources.
- Operational Efficiency Tracking: Helps evaluate how well the company uses its assets to manage working capital.
- Risk Management Tool: Identifies businesses with financial stress or overleveraged operations.

Limitations:
- Ignores Cash Flow Timing: Doesn’t reflect timing mismatches between cash inflows and outflows.
- Industry Dependence: Different industries have varying benchmarks, making cross-sector comparisons unreliable.
- Temporary Distortions: Seasonal businesses may have fluctuating working capital, requiring adjustments.
- No Long-Term Viability Check: Focuses only on short-term liquidity, ignoring long-term solvency risks.

Key Takeaway:
- The Working Capital to Total Assets Ratio evaluates a company’s liquidity strength and operational efficiency by measuring the proportion of current resources available relative to total assets.
- Use it alongside Current Ratio, Quick Ratio, and Debt Ratios for a comprehensive financial assessment.
