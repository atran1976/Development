Description:
- Net Profit Margin is a profitability metric that measures the percentage of revenue remaining as net income after all expenses.

Formula:
- Net Profit Margin = ( Net Profit / Revenue)

Interpretation:
- Net Profit Margin = 150 / 1000 = 0.15 or 15%
- The company generates $0.15 as profit for every $1 of revenue.

Key Insights:
- High Net Profit Margin (> Industry Average):
	Reflects strong profitability and cost control.
	Indicates pricing power or operational efficiency.
- Low Net Profit Margin (< Industry Average):
	Suggests high expenses or pricing pressure.
	May indicate inefficiencies or competitive weaknesses.
- Negative Net Profit Margin:
	Indicates losses and potential financial distress.

Limitations:
- One-time gains or losses, like asset sales or legal settlements can inflate margins, masking poor operational performance.
- A company with high debt or tax liabilities may show a lower margin, even if its core operations are profitable.
- Companies with different capital structures are hard to compare using Net Profit Margin alone.

Key Takeaway:
- Net Profit Margin is a comprehensive profitability metric that evaluates how much of a company’s revenue turns into profit.
- Combine it with Operating Margin, EBITDA Margin, and ROE for a detailed financial analysis.
