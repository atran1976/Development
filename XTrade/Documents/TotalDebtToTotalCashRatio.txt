TotalDebt-To-TotalCash Ratio = Total Debt / Total Cash

It assets the company's liquidity and its ability to meet its financial obligations. 

Lower Ratio (Below 1): 
A ratio below 1 indicates that the company has more cash on hand than its total debt. This suggests good liquidity and a strong ability to cover its short-term obligations.

Higher Ratio (Above 1):
A ratio above 1 means that the company has more total debt than total cash. This could be a sign that the company may face challenges in meeting its short-term obligations with its existing cash reserves.
