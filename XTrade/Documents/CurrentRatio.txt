Description:
- The Current Ratio is a liquidity ratio that measures a company’s ability to pay off its short-term obligations using its current assets. 
- It evaluates whether a company has sufficient resources to cover its current liabilities within one year.

Formula:
- Current Ratio =  Current Assets / Current Liabilities

​Interpretation:
- Current Ratio = 150/100 = 1.5
- The company has $1.50 in assets for every $1.00 in liabilities.

Key Insights:
- CR > 1 The company has more current assets than current liabilities, indicating it can cover its short-term obligations.
- CR < 1 The company may struggle to meet its short-term obligations.
- CR = 1 The company may not have enough assets to meet its short-term debts, indicating liquidity concerns.
- CR between 1.5 & 3 is considered healthy
- While a CR > 1 is generally considered healthy, an excessively high ratio might suggest that a company is NOT efficiently using its current assets to generate returns.

- Liquidity Management: Higher ratios indicate liquidity strength, while lower ratios may point to cash flow constraints.
- Operational Efficiency: Excessively high ratios (>3.0) may suggest underutilized assets or poor resource allocation.
- Risk Analysis: Ratios below 1.0 signal financial stress, requiring scrutiny of receivables and cash reserves.
- Growth vs Stability Balance: Companies with lower ratios might focus on growth investments, while those with higher ratios may prioritize financial stability.

Advantages:
- Liquidity Snapshot: Provides a quick assessment of a company’s ability to meet obligations.
- Comparative Analysis: Easily compares liquidity strength across companies within an industry.
- Operational Efficiency Check: Highlights whether a company is managing working capital effectively.

Limitations:
- Ignores Cash Flow Timing: Doesn’t account for timing differences between cash inflows and outflows.
- Inventory Dependency: Includes inventory, which may not be easily liquidated during financial distress. (Quick Ratio addresses this)
- Industry Variations: Capital-intensive industries (e.g., utilities) naturally have lower ratios, making cross-industry comparisons less meaningful.
- Excludes Debt Repayment Costs: Doesn’t account for interest payments on long-term debt, which may affect liquidity.

Key Takeaway:
- The Current Ratio evaluates a company’s short-term liquidity and ability to cover liabilities using current assets.
- Use with Quick Ratio, Cash Ratio, and Working Capital for a comprehensive liquidity analysis.
