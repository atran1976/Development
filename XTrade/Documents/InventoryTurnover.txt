Description:
- Days Inventory Outstanding (DIO), which measures the average number of days a company takes to sell its inventory. 
- It evaluates how efficiently inventory is managed, highlighting the liquidity of inventory and operational efficiency.

Formula:
- DIO = (((Beginning Inventory + Ending Inventory) / 2 ) / Cost of Revenue ) * 365

Interpretation:
- DIO = (210 / 1000) * 365 = 76.65 days
- It takes the company approximately 77 days to sell its inventory.

Key Insights:
- Low DIO (< 30 days): (High Efficiency)
	Inventory is sold quickly, reflecting strong demand or just-in-time inventory practices.	
	Suitable for retail and fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) sectors.
- Moderate DIO (30–90 days): (Balanced Efficiency)
	Reflects average inventory turnover, common for manufacturing and capital-intensive industries.
- High DIO (> 90 days): (Slow Turnover or Overstocking)
	Inventory takes longer to sell, suggesting low demand, poor inventory management, or overstocking risks.
	Suitable for industries with seasonal products or long production cycles like automobiles.

- Inventory Management Efficiency: High DIO indicates slow-moving inventory, risking obsolescence or carrying costs. (Optimize inventory levels.)
- Liquidity Monitoring: Low DIO improves liquidity, enabling faster cash cycles and reducing working capital needs. (Analyze CCC.)
- Growth vs Stability Analysis: High DIO in growth phases may signal inventory buildup for future demand, while low DIO in mature businesses reflects tight inventory control.
- Seasonal Patterns Impact: DIO may rise during off-peak seasons and fall during peak periods—analyze trends to normalize data.

Advantages:
- Operational Efficiency Indicator: Tracks how effectively inventory is converted to sales, supporting supply chain optimization.
- Liquidity and Cash Flow Analysis: Evaluates whether inventory ties up cash, impacting working capital cycles.
- Benchmark Comparisons: Suitable for comparing inventory practices across peer groups and industries.

Limitations:
- Industry Sensitivity: DIO varies significantly by industry—benchmark comparisons within peer groups are essential. (Avoid cross-sector analysis.)
- Seasonal Variations: Inventory patterns may fluctuate, requiring quarterly adjustments for accurate analysis. (Normalize data.)
- Profitability Ignored: Focuses only on inventory efficiency, not whether it contributes to profitability. (Pair with gross profit margin.)
- Excludes Future Trends: Doesn’t account for future sales projections—may misrepresent growth-focused inventory buildup. (Analyze sales forecasts.)

Key Takeaway:
- Days Inventory Outstanding (DIO) measures how quickly inventory is sold, reflecting operational efficiency and cash flow management.
- Combine it with DSO, DPO, and the Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC) for a complete working capital analysis.
