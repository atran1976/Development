Description:
- Free Cash Flow (FCF) / Market Cap ratio measures a company’s ability to generate free cash flow relative to its market value. 
- It represents the return investors receive in the form of free cash flow for every dollar invested in the company's equity.

Formula:
- Free Cash Flow / Market Cap

Interpretation:
- Free Cash Flow / Market Cap = 200 / 2000 = 0.10 or 10%
- The company generates $0.10 in free cash flow for every $1 of market value.

Key Insights:
- High Yield (>5%): (Attractive Valuation)
	Indicates the company generates substantial free cash flow relative to its market value.
	May signal undervaluation or strong cash-generating ability.
- Moderate Yield (3–5%): (Fair Valuation): Reflects a reasonable balance between market value and cash flow generation.
- Low Yield (<3%): (Expensive Valuation): Suggests the company’s market value is high relative to its cash flow, often seen in high-growth companies with reinvestment priorities.

- Valuation Metric: Indicates the proportion of the company's market value supported by its free cash flow.
- Investor Yield: Helps investors assess the cash return on their equity investment.

- Cash Return to Investors: A higher yield indicates better cash flow returns relative to market value, attractive to value-oriented investors.
- Growth vs. Value Companies: Growth-oriented companies often reinvest cash flow, resulting in lower yields. Mature, stable companies typically have higher yields, reflecting stronger free cash flow relative to market value.
- Liquidity Assessment: Companies with consistently high yields are likely to have strong liquidity and the ability to fund growth, dividends, or debt repayment.

Advantages:
- Focus on Cash Flow: Highlights cash-generating ability, which is critical for sustainability and shareholder returns.
- Investor-Centric Metric: Directly relates free cash flow to market value, making it intuitive for investors.
- Comparable Across Industries: Useful for comparing companies with similar capital structures and market caps.

Limitations:
- Excludes Growth Potential: A high yield may not account for future growth prospects, potentially undervaluing growth-focused companies.
- Industry Sensitivity: Benchmarks vary significantly across industries, limiting cross-sector comparisons.
- Market Volatility: Fluctuations in stock price and market cap can distort the ratio over short periods.

Key Takeaway:
- Free Cash Flow / Market Cap provides a snapshot of a company’s ability to generate cash flow relative to its market value.
- A higher yield (>5%) indicates strong cash flow returns, while a lower yield (<3%) may reflect reinvestment priorities or overvaluation.
- Combine this metric with profitability, growth, and leverage ratios for a comprehensive valuation analysis.
