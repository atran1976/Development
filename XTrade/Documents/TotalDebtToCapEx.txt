Description:
- Total Debt / Capital Expenditure ratio measures the extent to which a company's capital expenditures are supported by its total debt. 
- It reflects a company’s reliance on debt financing for investing in its infrastructure, assets, and operational capacity.

Formula:
- Total Debt / Capital Expenditure

Interpretation:
- Total Debt / Capital Expenditure = 600 / 150 = 4.0
- The company’s total debt is 4 times its capital expenditures.
- The company has $4 of Total Debt for every $1 of CapEx.

Key Insights:
- Low Ratio (<2x): (Low Debt Dependence): Indicates the company relies less on debt for CapEx, suggesting a strong internal funding capability.
- Moderate Ratio (2–5x): (Balanced Financing): Reflects a reasonable mix of debt and other sources of funding for capital investments.
- High Ratio (>5x): (High Debt Reliance): Suggests heavy dependence on debt financing for CapEx, increasing financial risk.

- Debt Financing Assessment: Indicates how heavily a company relies on debt to fund its CapEx investments.
- Leverage Analysis: Reflects the financial burden associated with growth and operational expansion.

- Debt Funding for Growth: A higher ratio indicates greater reliance on debt for funding growth and asset acquisition, which may pose risks during economic downturns.
- Industry Dependence: 
	Capital-intensive industries (e.g., energy, manufacturing) naturally have higher ratios due to substantial CapEx requirements.
	Asset-light industries (e.g., software) tend to have lower ratios, reflecting minimal CapEx needs.
- Leverage and Risk: Companies with consistently high ratios may face higher interest obligations and liquidity pressures, particularly if cash flows decline.

Advantages:
- Leverage Analysis: Highlights the company’s dependence on debt for operational growth and expansion.
- Capital Allocation Insight: Reflects the balance between internal funding and external debt for CapEx investments.
- Industry Comparisons: Useful for benchmarking within industries to assess funding strategies.

Limitations:
- Doesn’t Reflect Efficiency: A high ratio doesn’t indicate whether the CapEx investments are efficient or profitable. (Combine with ROA or ROIC for a complete picture.)
- Excludes Other Funding Sources: Ignores equity financing, retained earnings, or other sources of CapEx funding.
- Short-Term Volatility: CapEx and debt levels can vary year-to-year due to project cycles or financing decisions.

Key Takeaway:
- Total Debt / Capital Expenditure measures the reliance on debt to fund capital investments, with lower ratios (<2x) indicating a more conservative financing strategy.
- A higher ratio (>5x) may signal significant debt dependence, which could pose financial risks during economic downturns or periods of declining cash flow.
- Combine this ratio with other leverage, profitability, and efficiency metrics for a comprehensive financial analysis.
