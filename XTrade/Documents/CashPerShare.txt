Description:
- It measures the amount of cash available per outstanding share of a company's stock.

Formula:
- Cash Per Share = Total Cash and Cash Equivalents / Total Number of Outstanding Shares

​Interpretation:
- CPS = 1,000 / 100 = 10
- The company has $10 cash per share available.

Key Insights:
- Liquidity Indicator: A high cash per share suggests strong liquidity and financial stability.
- Debt Coverage: Companies with high cash per share can repay debt quickly without requiring additional financing.
- Risk Assessment: Investors may view low cash per share as a risk, especially in downturns.
- Shareholder Security: High cash per share may act as a buffer against economic uncertainties.

- Higher Cash Per Share: 
	Signals strong liquidity and financial stability.
	May indicate the ability to repay debt, fund expansion, or distribute dividends.
- Lower Cash Per Share:
	Suggests tight cash reserves, possibly limiting financial flexibility.
	Could indicate aggressive reinvestment into growth rather than holding cash.



Limitations:
- No Profitability Insight: High cash reserves do not guarantee profitability or growth potential.
- Capital Utilization: Excess cash may indicate inefficient use of capital, especially if it’s not reinvested into growth opportunities.
- Industry Variations: Industries like tech and financial services tend to maintain higher cash reserves, while utilities and real estate typically have lower reserves due to fixed asset investments.
- Temporary Cash Levels: Cash balances may fluctuate significantly, especially after fundraising events or asset sales.

Key Takeaway:
- Cash Per Share is a liquidity-focused metric ideal for evaluating a company’s financial stability.
- It’s most useful when combined with other metrics like P/B ratio, P/E ratio, and debt-to-equity ratio for a complete valuation analysis.
