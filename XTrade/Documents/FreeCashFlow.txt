Description:
- Free Cash Flow (FCF) represents the cash generated by a company’s operations that is available for distribution to investors (shareholders and creditors) after accounting for capital expenditures (CapEx). 
- It evaluates a company’s financial flexibility, liquidity, and capacity for growth, dividends, debt repayment, or share buybacks.

Formula:
- FCF = Operating Cash Flow − Capital Expenditures
 
Interpretation:
- FCF = 500,000 − 150,000 = 350,000
- The company has $350,000 in free cash flow, available for growth investments, debt repayment, or dividends.

Key Insights:
- Positive FCF: (Healthy Cash Flow)
	The company generates more cash than it needs for reinvestments.
	Supports growth, dividends, and debt repayment without relying on external financing.
- Negative FCF: (Cash Flow Deficit)
	The company spends more than it generates, often due to expansion or large CapEx investments.
	May require external financing to sustain operations or growth initiatives. (Monitor closely.)

- Cash Flow Strength Indicator: Positive FCF highlights a company’s ability to self-fund operations, supporting growth without reliance on debt financing.
- Debt Repayment Capacity: High FCF allows for faster debt reduction, improving credit ratings and financial stability. (Pair with leverage ratios.)
- Growth vs Profitability Balance: Negative FCF in growth stages may indicate reinvestment strategies, but persistent deficits raise sustainability concerns. (Analyze trends.)
- Dividend and Buyback Funding: FCF supports shareholder returns through dividends and stock buybacks, reflecting financial health. (Monitor payout ratios.)

Advantages:
- Cash Profitability Focus: Unlike earnings metrics, FCF evaluates actual cash generation, minimizing accounting distortions.
- Growth Potential Analysis: Tracks available cash for expansion, debt repayment, or shareholder returns.
- Liquidity Testing Tool: Assesses whether the company can cover CapEx needs and debt obligations without raising external capital.

Limitations:
- Excludes Non-Cash Adjustments: FCF doesn’t account for non-operating gains or losses, potentially distorting performance views. (Combine with net income metrics.)
- Cyclical Variations: Capital-intensive companies may show negative FCF during growth phases, requiring trend analysis over time.
- Industry Dependence: FCF benchmarks vary widely by sector, making peer comparisons more relevant than cross-industry evaluations.
- Doesn’t Measure Profitability: Focuses on cash efficiency, ignoring whether revenue translates into earnings growth. (Pair with net profit margin.)

Key Takeaway:
- Free Cash Flow (FCF) measures how much cash is available after capital expenditures, highlighting a company’s financial health, liquidity, and growth potential.
- Combine it with profitability metrics, leverage ratios, and cash flow analysis for a comprehensive financial assessment.
