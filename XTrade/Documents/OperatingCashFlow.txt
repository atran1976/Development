Description:
- Operating Cash Flow (OCF) measures the cash generated by a company’s core business operations, excluding investment and financing activities.
- It evaluates the company’s ability to generate cash from day-to-day operations to fund working capital, pay expenses, reinvest in growth, and service debt.

Formula:
- Operating Cash Flow (OCF) = Net Income + Depreciation + Amortization + Changes in Working Capital

Interpretation:
- OCF = 225,000
- The company generates $225,000 in cash flow from its operations.

Key Insights:
- Positive OCF: (Healthy Operations)
	Core operations generate sufficient cash to sustain growth, pay expenses, and service debt.
	Indicates financial stability and profitability.
- Negative OCF: (Cash Flow Deficit)
	Core operations consume cash, potentially requiring external financing to support operations.
	May indicate losses, working capital inefficiencies, or growth-phase investments. (Monitor closely.)

- Liquidity Indicator: Positive OCF highlights cash-rich operations, supporting growth, investments, and financial stability. (Pair with quick ratios.)
- Growth vs Profitability Balance: Negative OCF during growth phases may reflect high reinvestments, but persistent deficits raise sustainability concerns. (Monitor CapEx and trends.)
- Debt Repayment Capacity: High OCF improves debt servicing ability, reducing reliance on external financing. (Analyze leverage ratios.)
- Investment Opportunities: OCF supports shareholder returns through dividends and buybacks, reflecting strong cash reserves. (Compare to FCF yield.)

Advantages:
- Cash Profitability Focus: Evaluates actual cash inflows rather than relying on non-cash accounting metrics like net income.
- Debt Repayment Analysis: Tracks whether operating cash flow is sufficient to cover debt obligations and growth investments.
- Liquidity and Flexibility: Highlights whether a company can sustain day-to-day operations without relying on external financing.

Limitations:
- Short-Term Focus: Doesn’t account for long-term investments or future profitability—use with CapEx analysis. (Track trends over time.)
- Ignores Financing and Investing Activities: Focuses only on core operations, excluding impacts from debt financing or asset sales. (Combine with FCF and ROI metrics.)
- Cyclical Variability: Industries with seasonal cash flows may show fluctuations, requiring quarterly adjustments for comparisons. (Normalize trends.)
- Working Capital Sensitivity: Changes in receivables, inventory, or payables can inflate or deflate OCF without impacting real performance. (Pair with CCC.)

Key Takeaway:
- Operating Cash Flow (OCF) measures a company’s ability to generate cash from core business activities, providing insights into liquidity, debt repayment capacity, and growth potential.
- Combine it with profitability metrics, FCF, and leverage ratios for a comprehensive financial assessment.
