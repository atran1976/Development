Description:
- The Net Debt to EBITDA Ratio measures a company’s ability to repay its net debt (total debt minus cash and cash equivalents) using its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA). 
- It evaluates leverage, debt repayment capacity, and financial health by showing how many years of earnings are required to pay off net debt.

Formula:
- Net Debt-to-EBITDA Ratio = Net Debt / EBITDA

Interpretation:
- Net Debt to EBITDA = 170 / 100 = 1.7
- The company’s Net Debt to EBITDA Ratio is 1.7x, meaning it would take approximately 1.7 years of earnings (before interest, taxes, and depreciation) to pay off its net debt.

Key Insights:
- Low Ratio (< 1.0): (Strong Solvency): The company can pay off its debt quickly, signaling low risk and financial flexibility.
- Moderate Ratio (1.0–3.0): (Healthy Leverage): Balanced use of debt financing, with earnings covering debt within 1–3 years.
- High Ratio (> 3.0): (Higher Risk): The company may face liquidity risks and debt repayment challenges, especially during economic downturns.
- Very High Ratio (> 5.0): (Highly Leveraged): Significant financial stress, potentially requiring debt restructuring or equity injections.

- Debt Repayment Capability: Reflects how quickly a company can pay off its net debt using operating earnings.
- Leverage vs Profitability Balance: Low ratios highlight financial strength, while high ratios may indicate over-leverage or cash flow stress.
- Growth Opportunities: Companies with low ratios have room to borrow more for growth investments, while high ratios may limit borrowing capacity.
- Economic Sensitivity: In industries with cyclical revenues (e.g., energy), high ratios raise concerns about financial vulnerability.

Advantages:
- Focuses on Cash Flow Capacity: Highlights whether earnings can support debt repayment effectively.
- Comparability Across Industries: Widely used across industries to assess leverage and financial health.
- Investor and Lender Confidence: Ratios under 3.0x improve creditworthiness and make borrowing cheaper.

Limitations:
- Ignores Interest and Taxes: EBITDA excludes interest payments and taxes, which affect actual cash flows. (Combine with cash flow ratios for deeper insights.)
- Capital-Intensive Businesses: Industries like utilities and real estate naturally operate with higher debt ratios, requiring contextual analysis.
- Short-Term Focus: Doesn’t reflect long-term obligations or debt maturities that may strain cash flow.
- EBITDA Manipulation: EBITDA can be adjusted to exclude one-time costs, potentially overstating profitability.

Key Takeaway:
- The Net Debt to EBITDA Ratio evaluates a company’s leverage and ability to repay debt using operating earnings, offering insights into solvency risks and financial health.
- Combine it with Interest Coverage, Cash Flow Ratios, and Debt-to-Equity for a comprehensive leverage analysis.
