Definition:
- ROE (Return on Equity) Margin is a profitability metric that measures how effectively a company generates net income from its shareholders' equity

Formula:
- ROE = Net Income / Average Shareholders’ Equity

Interpretation:
- ROE = 200/800 = 0.25 or 25%
- The company generates $0.25 cents of profit for every $1 of equity invested by shareholders.

Key Insights:
- A higher ROE ratio is generally viewed positively and indicates that the company is efficient in generating returns for its shareholders. 
- A lower ROE ratio may indicate less efficient use of equity capital to generate profit. 
- A negative ROE may suggest financial distress or poor performance.

Note:
Warrent Buffet prefers ROE >= 20%

Limitations:
- High debt financing can inflate ROE.
- ROE doesn’t capture future growth potential
- One-time gains or losses can distort ROE.

Key Takeaways:
- Best analyzed with other metrics, such as ROCE, ROA, and Net Profit Margin, for a complete view of profitability and efficiency.
