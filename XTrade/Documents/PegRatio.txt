Description:
- The PEG ratio improves upon the P/E ratio by incorporating a company's earnings growth rate into its valuation. 
- It evaluates whether a stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, considering its growth potential.

Formula:
- PEGRatio = PERatio / EarningsGrowthRate

Example:
- PEG = 20/10 = 2.0
- PEG = 2.0 suggests the stock might be overvalued based on its growth prospects.

Interpretation:
- PEG < 1.0 → Undervalued: Stock is trading below its expected growth potential.
- PEG = 1.0 → Fairly Valued: Stock’s price matches its growth potential.
- PEG > 1.0 → Overvalued: Stock may be expensive relative to its growth.

Key Insights:
- Growth Adjusted Valuation: Unlike P/E, PEG adjusts for growth rates, making it better for growth stocks.
- Fair Value Indicator: A PEG near 1.0 is ideal for a balanced valuation between price and growth.
- Comparison Tool: Useful for comparing companies in high-growth sectors, such as technology and biotech.

Limitations of PEG Ratio:
- Growth Estimates Are Uncertain: Relies on analyst forecasts, which may be inaccurate or optimistic.
- Short-Term Focus: Focuses on 1–5 years of growth, ignoring long-term sustainability.
- Ignores Risk and Profitability: Does not account for debt, cash flow, or business risks.
- Negative or Low Growth Rates: Cannot be used for companies with negative growth or very low growth rates, as it may produce misleading results.
- Industry-Specific Variability: High-growth industries often have higher PEGs, so comparisons should be within the same sector.

Key Takeaway: 
- Combine PEG ratio with P/E ratio, ROE, and cash flow analysis to get a comprehensive view of valuation and growth potential.
- Analyze trends in growth rates and earnings consistency before making decisions.
