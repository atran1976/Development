Description:
- Current Liabilities provides insight into a company’s ability to cover short-term debts.

Formula:
- Current Liabilities = Accounts Payable + Short-term Debt+Accrued Expenses + Unearned Revenue + Current Portion of Long-term Debt + Other Current Liabilities

Key Insights:
- High current liabilities relative to assets may signal cash flow challenges.
- Rising accounts payable can reflect a company’s negotiating power with suppliers or indicate cash shortages.
- Helps track payments to suppliers and vendors, revealing trends in working capital.
- Highlights whether a company needs external financing to meet near-term obligations.

Limitations:
- Timing Differences: Liabilities may fluctuate seasonally, leading to misleading results without context.
- Industry Dependence: Capital-intensive industries (utilities) often carry higher debt, making comparisons cross-industry unreliable.
- Excludes Long-Term Obligations: Doesn’t address long-term solvency—use Total Liabilities for a broader view.
- Overstatement Risk: Unearned revenue may overstate liabilities without affecting cash outflows.

Key Takeaway:
- Current Liabilities are crucial for evaluating short-term financial obligations and liquidity risk.
- Combine with Current Ratio, Quick Ratio, and Working Capital for a comprehensive liquidity assessment.
