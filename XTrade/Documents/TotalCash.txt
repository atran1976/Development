Definition:
Cash and cash equivalents (CCE) are the most liquid assets on a company's balance sheet. They include cash in hand and other short-term, highly liquid investments that are easily convertible to known amounts of cash with minimal risk of value fluctuation.

Why It Matter?
Liquidity Management: 
CCE are essential for meeting immediate financial obligations and ensuring smooth operational flow. They provide a cushion for unexpected expenses or financial emergencies.

Financial Health: 
High levels of CCE indicate a company's ability to cover short-term liabilities, which is a sign of strong financial health.

Investment Opportunities: 
Companies with substantial CCE are better positioned to take advantage of investment opportunities or strategic acquisitions quickly.

Creditworthiness: 
A strong CCE position enhances a companyâ€™s credit profile, making it easier to obtain financing on favorable terms.
