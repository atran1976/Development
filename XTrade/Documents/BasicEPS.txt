Description:
- Earnings Per Share (EPS) is a profitability metric. It measures the portion of a company's profit allocated to each outstanding share of common stock.

Formula:
- EPS =  (Net Income − Preferred Dividends) / Weighted Average Number of Common Shares Outstanding

​Key Insights:
- It represents the portion of a company's profit allocated to each outstanding share of common stock.
- A higher EPS indicates better profitability on a per-share basis, which is generally favorable for investors.

Limitations:
- Shares Outstanding Impact: Stock buybacks can inflate EPS without improving actual profitability.
- Accounting Adjustments: Earnings can be manipulated through accounting practices, affecting EPS reliability.
- Focuses Only on Equity Holders: Ignores obligations to debt holders, focusing purely on common shareholders.

Key Takeaways:
- EPS is a profitability metric that measures per-share earnings, providing insights into a company's financial health.
- It is critical for investors to compare companies and evaluate growth potential.
- Use EPS alongside other profitability ratios like Net Profit Margin and ROE for a complete analysis.
- Be cautious of one-time gains/losses that may distort EPS.
