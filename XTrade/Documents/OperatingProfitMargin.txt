Description:
Operating Income Margin is a profitability metric that measures how much profit a company generates from core business activities after operating costs.

Formula:
Operating Income Margin = ( Operating Income / Revenue ) Ã— 100

Key Components:
- A higher operating income margin indicates that a company is more efficient at controlling its operating expenses and is better positioned to generate profits from its core business activities. It indicates strong operational efficiency and pricing power.
- A lower margin suggests higher operating expenses relative to revenue, which can impact overall profitability. It signals higher costs or pricing pressures, often seen in retail and manufacturing industries.
