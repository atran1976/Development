Description:
- EBITDA measures a company's operating performance by excluding the effects of financing decisions, tax strategies, and non-cash expenses like depreciation and amortization.

Formula:
- EBITDA = EBIT + Depreciation + Amortization

Key Insights:
- EBITDA isolates operating performance by removing non-operating expenses and non-cash charges.

Limitations:
- Ignores Debt and Interest Payments: May overstate profitability for companies with high leverage.
- Excludes Capital Expenditures (CapEx): Does not account for necessary reinvestments in fixed assets to sustain growth.
- Non-GAAP Metric: EBITDA is not defined under GAAP, so companies may adjust components, leading to inconsistencies.

Key Takeaway:
- EBITDA is ideal for evaluating core profitability, particularly in capital-intensive industries.
- Combine it with metrics like Net Income, Operating Income, Cash Flow, and Debt Ratios for a complete financial analysis.
