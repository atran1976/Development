Description:
- Operating Cash Flow / Net Debt ratio measures a company’s ability to repay its net debt using its operating cash flow. 
- It reflects the company’s liquidity, financial health, and capacity to manage its debt obligations with internally generated cash.

Formula:
- Operating Cash Flow / Net Debt

Interpretation:
- Operating Cash Flow / Net Debt = 300 / 550 = 0.54 or 54%
- The company can repay 54.5% of its net debt using one year of operating cash flow.
- The company has $0.54 of net debt for every $1 of operating cash flow.

Key Insights:
- High Ratio (>50%): (Healthy Liquidity): Indicates strong debt repayment capacity. The company can manage its debt comfortably from internally generated cash flows.
- Moderate Ratio (20–50%): (Manageable Liquidity): Reflects adequate ability to manage debt but may require close monitoring.
- Low Ratio (<20%): (Weak Liquidity): Suggests the company may struggle to cover its debt from operations, increasing dependence on external funding or refinancing.

- Evaluates whether the company generates sufficient cash flow from operations to cover its debt.
- Indicates the company’s financial resilience and its ability to repay debt without relying on external funding.

- Debt Servicing Ability: A higher ratio indicates the company generates sufficient cash flow to cover its debt, reducing financial risk.
- Financial Stability: A low ratio may signal potential liquidity issues, especially during economic downturns or earnings declines.
- Industry Sensitivity: Asset-heavy industries (e.g., energy, utilities) typically have lower ratios due to significant long-term debt. 
		      Asset-light industries (e.g., tech) generally have higher ratios, reflecting lower leverage and stronger cash flows.

Advantages:
- Liquidity Assessment: Directly links operating performance to debt repayment capacity.
- Debt Risk Indicator: Highlights the company’s ability to service debt from its core operations without relying on external funding.
- Ease of Calculation: Requires readily available data from the cash flow statement and balance sheet.

Limitations:
- Short-Term View: Focuses on current operating cash flow and net debt, without considering long-term debt maturities or growth needs.
- Excludes Non-Operating Cash Flows: Ignores other cash flows (e.g., investing or financing activities) that may affect the company’s debt management strategy.
- Industry Variability: Ratios vary significantly between industries, making cross-industry comparisons less meaningful.

Key Takeaway:
- Operating Cash Flow / Net Debt measures the company’s ability to cover its debt obligations using internally generated cash.
- A higher ratio (>50%) indicates strong financial health and debt repayment capacity, while a lower ratio (<20%) signals potential liquidity concerns.
- Combine with profitability, leverage, and interest coverage metrics for a comprehensive analysis of financial health.
