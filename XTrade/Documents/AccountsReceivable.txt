Description:
- Accounts Receivable (AR) represents the money owed to a company by its customers for goods or services sold on credit.

Formula:
- Accounts Receivable (AR) = Total Credit Sales − Collections Received − Write-Offs

Key Insights:
- Liquidity Indicator: High AR may signal delayed payments or cash flow risks.
- Credit Management: Tracks the efficiency of credit sales policies and payment collection.
- Revenue Predictability: Provides visibility into future cash inflows from credit customers.
- Risk Monitoring: Rising AR balances without collections could indicate bad debt risks or customer disputes.

Limitations:
- Bad Debt Risk: Customers may default on payments, requiring write-offs.
- Liquidity Misrepresentation: High AR may appear as an asset but lacks immediate liquidity.
- Collection Costs: Managing and collecting AR can involve administrative expenses.
- Seasonal Variations: AR levels may fluctuate, requiring adjustments for seasonality in analysis.

Key Takeaway:
- Accounts Receivable is a critical measure of short-term liquidity and credit management efficiency.
- Use metrics like AR Turnover Ratio and Days Sales Outstanding (DSO or ReceivableTurnover) to assess collection performance.
