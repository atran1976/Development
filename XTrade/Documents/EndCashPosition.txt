Description:
- The Ending Cash Balance represents the total amount of cash and cash equivalents a company has at the end of an accounting period. 
- It reflects the net cash position after accounting for operating, investing, and financing activities.

Formula:
- Ending Cash Balance = Beginning Cash Balance + Net Cash Flow

Interpretation:
- Ending Cash = 140,000
- The company ends the period with $140,000 in cash and cash equivalents.

Key Insights:
- Liquidity Indicator: Measures the company’s ability to meet obligations, pay dividends, or fund growth without relying on external financing. (Pair with quick ratios.)
- Cash Flow Transparency: Reflects whether the company’s cash flows from operations are self-sustaining or rely on external capital. (Analyze trends.)
- Working Capital Management: Ensures adequate cash to cover current liabilities and manage working capital cycles. (Combine with CCC.)
- Investor and Creditor Confidence: High cash reserves can improve credit ratings and boost investor confidence, especially during economic downturns. (Monitor liquidity ratios.)
- Cash Surpluses or Shortfalls: 
	High ending cash balances improve financial flexibility, but excess reserves may signal underinvestment in growth opportunities. (Monitor CapEx.) 
	Low cash balances may indicate liquidity risks requiring external funding or debt restructuring. (Analyze OCF trends.)
- Debt vs Equity Financing: Positive financing flows may support growth, while persistent reliance may signal leverage risks. (Evaluate D/E ratio.)
- Growth vs Stability Focus: Growth-stage firms often show low cash balances due to heavy reinvestments, while mature companies maintain higher balances for dividends and buybacks. (Track FCF trends.)
- Crisis Preparedness: High cash reserves improve resilience during economic downturns, enabling opportunistic acquisitions or debt buybacks. (Compare against industry norms.)

Advantages:
- Liquidity and Stability Monitoring: Tracks whether the company has sufficient cash to meet obligations and fund operations without external financing.
- Trend Analysis and Planning: Provides insights into cash flow cycles, supporting forecasting and budgeting decisions.
- Debt Servicing and Growth Testing: Evaluates whether cash reserves support debt repayments and expansion opportunities. (Monitor leverage ratios.)

Limitations:
- Ignores Profitability: High cash balances don’t necessarily mean profitability—requires analysis of earnings metrics. (Pair with ROI.)
- No Context for Cash Flows: Ending cash doesn’t explain whether it results from operations, financing, or asset sales—requires full cash flow statement analysis. (Track OCF, ICF, and FCF.)
- Liquidity vs Growth Tradeoff: Large cash reserves may reflect conservative strategies, potentially sacrificing growth investments. (Analyze CapEx trends.)
- Short-Term Focus: Focuses on current liquidity, offering no insights into future cash flow projections. (Perform cash forecasts.)

Key Takeaway:
- Ending Cash Balance reflects the net cash position at the end of a period, offering insights into liquidity, cash flow management, and capital strategies.
- Combine it with operating cash flow, free cash flow, and liquidity ratios for a comprehensive financial analysis.
