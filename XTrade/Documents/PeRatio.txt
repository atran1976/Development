Description:
- It compares a company's current stock price to its earnings per share (EPS). It is a valuation ratio that provides insights into how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of a company's earnings.
- How many years it take to get your back initial invested amt?

Formula:
- PE Ratio = Market Price per Share / Earnings per Share (EPS)

Example:
- P/E = (100/5) = 20 
- Investors are willing to pay $20 for every $1 of earnings.

Types of P/E Ratios:
- Trailing P/E:
	Uses actual earnings from the last 12 months.
	Reflects past performance but may not predict future growth.
- Forward P/E:
	Uses projected earnings for the next 12 months.
	Reflects future expectations but depends on estimates.

Interpretation:
- High P/E (> Industry Average): Investors expect high growth in the future, but it may also indicate overvaluation.
- Low P/E (< Industry Average): Could suggest a value stock or a company with low growth prospects.
- Negative P/E: Indicates losses instead of profits—often seen in startups or companies in distress.

Limitations:
- Ignores Growth: Doesn’t factor in future earnings growth. Use PEG ratio (P/E adjusted for growth) to account for growth rates.
- No Debt Consideration: P/E doesn’t reflect debt levels, which impact risk and profitability.
- Earnings Manipulation: EPS can be inflated through accounting tricks, affecting the P/E ratio.
- Industry Variations: P/E ratios vary widely between industries, making cross-industry comparisons unreliable.
- No Cash Flow Insight: Focuses on earnings, not cash flow, which may better indicate financial health.
- Negative Earnings Issue: Companies with negative earnings cannot have a P/E ratio, making comparisons difficult
