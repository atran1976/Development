Description:
- Market Cap / Net Income ratio measures how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of a company’s net income. 

Formula:
- Market Cap / Net Income

Interpretation:
- Market Cap / Net Income = 1000 / 200 = 5.0
- Investors are willing to pay $5 for every $1 of the company’s earnings.

Key Insights:
- High Ratio (>20): (Growth-Oriented Pricing)
	Indicates that investors expect significant future earnings growth.
	Common in industries like technology or healthcare with high growth potential.
- Moderate Ratio (10–20): (Fair Valuation)
	Suggests that the company is fairly valued based on its earnings.
- Low Ratio (<10): (Value-Oriented Pricing)
	May indicate undervaluation or a lack of investor confidence in the company’s future growth

- Indicates the valuation premium investors are assigning to a company’s earnings.
- Helps evaluate whether a company is overvalued, undervalued, or fairly priced relative to its peers or the market.

Advantages:
- Widely Used: One of the most popular metrics for comparing valuation across companies and industries.
- Easy to Calculate: Requires readily available data from financial statements and the stock market.
- Forward-Looking: Captures market expectations about future earnings growth.

Limitations:
- Ignores Growth Drivers: A low ratio doesn’t always indicate undervaluation; it could reflect low growth potential or high risk.
- Industry Comparisons: Ratios vary significantly across industries, making cross-sector comparisons less meaningful.
- Earnings Quality: The ratio doesn’t account for non-recurring items or the quality of earnings (e.g., cash-based vs. accrual-based).
- Market Volatility: Market capitalization is influenced by stock price fluctuations, which may distort the ratio during volatile periods.

Key Takeaway:
- Market Cap / Net Income (P/E ratio) is a critical valuation metric for assessing how much investors are willing to pay for a company’s earnings.
- A higher ratio (>20x) signals high growth expectations, while a lower ratio (<10x) may indicate undervaluation or financial challenges.
- Combine with other valuation and profitability metrics for a complete analysis of a company’s financial health and market positioning.
