Description:
- P/B Ratio (Price-to-Book Ratio) is a valuation metric that compares a company's market value to its book value (net asset value). 
- It helps investors determine whether a stock is overvalued or undervalued relative to its assets.

Formula:
- P/B Ratio = Market Price per Share / Book Value per Share

Example:
- P/B Ratio = (50 / 25) = 2
- Investors are paying $2 for every $1 of net assets.

Interpretation:
- P/B < 1 – Stock may be undervalued (trading below its asset value).
- P/B = 1 – Stock is fairly valued (trading at its book value).
- P/B > 1 – Stock may be overvalued or expected to generate higher returns based on growth potential.

- Asset-Driven Analysis: Useful for companies with tangible assets, such as banks, real estate, and manufacturers.
- Stable Measure: Book value is relatively stable, unlike earnings, which may fluctuate.
- Downside Protection: A low P/B ratio may offer a margin of safety during downturns.

- Stable Valuation for Asset-Heavy Firms: Ideal for industries with tangible assets like banks, real estate, and manufacturing.
- CapExToNetIncome = CapitalExpenditure / NetIncome) * 100 = Determine if a company is capital intensive

Limitations:
- Ignores Intangible Assets: Doesn’t capture the value of brand reputation, patents, or goodwill, which are significant for tech and service-based companies.
- Industry Differences: Capital-intensive industries (e.g., energy and utilities) may naturally have lower P/B ratios, making cross-industry comparisons unreliable.
- Profitability Ignored: A low P/B ratio doesn’t guarantee profitability; companies may have weak earnings or negative cash flow.
- Debt Impact: High debt levels can artificially inflate book value, leading to misleading conclusions.

Key Takeaway:
- Use P/B ratio with other metrics like P/E, ROE, and debt-to-equity ratio to gain a complete picture of a company’s valuation.
- It's ideal for analyzing capital-intensive industries and companies with tangible assets but less effective for firms with intangible assets.
