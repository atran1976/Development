Description:
- The Capital Expenditures to Net Income Ratio measures the proportion of a company’s net income that is being reinvested into the business through capital expenditures (CapEx). 
- It evaluates a company’s growth strategy, capital intensity, and its ability to fund expansion while generating profits.

Formula:
- CapEx to Net Income Ratio =  Capital Expenditure / Net Income

Interpretation:
- CapEx to Net Income Ratio =  200 / 400 = 0.50 or 50%
- The company reinvests 50% of its net income into capital expenditures
- The company has $0.50 of CapEx for every $1 of Net Income

Key Insights:
- Low Ratio (< 25%): (Conservative Investment): The company spends less on capital assets, prioritizing profit retention or dividends. May indicate a mature company with limited growth opportunities.
- Moderate Ratio (25–50%): (Balanced Growth Strategy): Reflects reasonable reinvestment for growth while maintaining profitability. Suitable for companies with stable revenues and expansion potential.
- High Ratio (> 50%): (Aggressive Investment): Indicates a focus on growth and expansion, common in early-stage or capital-intensive industries. High ratios may reduce dividends or require external financing.
- Very High Ratio (> 100%): (Overinvestment or Losses): CapEx exceeds net income, suggesting negative profits or reliance on borrowed funds for growth investments.

Growth vs Profitability Balance: High ratios suggest aggressive expansion, while low ratios imply profit preservation.
- Capital Intensity Monitoring: Asset-heavy industries (e.g., energy, utilities) naturally show higher CapEx due to infrastructure needs.
- Liquidity and Debt Risk: Companies with high CapEx and low net income may require external funding, raising leverage risk.
- Long-Term Investment Focus: High CapEx ratios indicate future growth potential, but require monitoring for short-term cash constraints.

Advantages:
- Growth Assessment Tool: Highlights whether the company is investing enough to support future growth.
- CapEx Efficiency Evaluation: Tracks how effectively earnings are reinvested into capital projects.
- Liquidity and Debt Monitoring: Identifies whether a company’s CapEx strategy may require external financing or debt restructuring.

Limitations:
- Excludes Debt Effects: Focuses only on earnings, ignoring how debt financing supports CapEx. (Combine with debt ratios.)
- Industry Variability: Capital-intensive industries have naturally higher ratios, making cross-industry comparisons unreliable. (Focus on industry-specific benchmarks.)
- Growth vs Maintenance CapEx: Doesn’t differentiate between growth investments and maintenance spending, potentially overstating growth-focused strategies. (Analyze CapEx breakdown if available.)
- Short-Term Focus: High ratios may indicate temporary growth initiatives, requiring long-term monitoring of returns. (Combine with ROA and ROE for profitability analysis.)

Key Takeaway:
- The CapEx to Net Income Ratio measures the proportion of profits reinvested into capital assets, offering insights into growth strategies, capital intensity, and cash flow management.
- Combine it with CapEx to Revenue, FCF, and leverage metrics for a comprehensive growth and risk analysis.
