Description:
- Accounts Payable (AP) represents the short-term obligations a company owes to its suppliers or vendors for goods or services purchased on credit.

Formula:
- Accounts Payable (AP)=Total Purchases on Credit−Payments Made

Key Insights:
- Liquidity Management: 
	High AP may reflect cash conservation or working capital management.
	Low AP could signal faster payments but may strain cash reserves.
- Supplier Relations:
	Longer payment cycles may strain vendor relationships.
	Favorable credit terms can extend DPO without penalties.
- Cash Flow Optimization:
	Companies may delay payments strategically to retain cash flow while avoiding late fees.

- Allows companies to purchase goods/services on credit and delay payments to optimize cash flow.
- Effective use of supplier credit reduces reliance on loans.

Limitations:
- Liquidity Risks: Excessive AP may signal liquidity struggles and damage supplier relationships.
- Interest and Late Fees: Delayed payments may result in penalties or interest charges if suppliers impose strict payment terms.
- Industry Variations: DPO and AP turnover vary significantly by industry, requiring contextual analysis.

Key Takeaway:
- Accounts Payable measures short-term payment obligations and helps assess a company’s liquidity and credit management efficiency.
- Use metrics like DPO and AP Turnover Ratio for insights into payment practices and cash flow management.
