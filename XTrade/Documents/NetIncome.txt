- The bottom line of a company’s income statement. It represents the total profit a company earns after deducting all expenses, including operating costs, interest, taxes, and non-operating items.

Formula:
Net Income = Total Revenue − (COGS + Operating Expenses + Interest + Taxes)

Key Insights:
- Indicates whether a company is profitable or losing money.
- Trends in Net Income reflect business growth or decline.

Limitations:
- Accounting Manipulations: Susceptible to accounting adjustments, such as depreciation methods and tax strategies.
- Non-Cash Items: Includes non-cash expenses (e.g., depreciation) that don’t impact cash flow, making EBITDA more useful for cash-focused analysis
- One-Time Events: Can be distorted by one-time gains or losses, such as asset sales or write-offs.
- Industry Variations: Profitability levels vary widely by industry, limiting cross-sector comparisons.

Key Takeaway:
- Net Income represents the final profitability of a company and is a key measure for valuation and dividend decisions.
- Combine it with metrics like Gross Profit, Operating Income, EBITDA, and Cash Flow for a holistic financial analysis.
