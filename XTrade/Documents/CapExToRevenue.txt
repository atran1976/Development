Description:
- Capital Expenditure (CapEx) / Total Revenue ratio measures the proportion of a company’s revenue that is being reinvested into its capital expenditures. 
- It reflects the company’s investment in maintaining or expanding its operational capacity relative to its revenue generation.

Formula:
-  CapEx / Total Revenue

Interpretation:
- CapEx / Total Revenue = 100 / 1000 = 0.10 or 10%
- The company is reinvesting 10% of its total revenue back into capital expenditures.

Key Insights:
- High Ratio (>10%): (Growth-Focused)
	Indicates significant investment in infrastructure, equipment, or expansion.
	Common in capital-intensive industries like utilities, energy, or manufacturing.
- Moderate Ratio (5–10%): (Balanced Approach)
	Reflects a mix of maintaining current assets and moderate growth investment.
- Low Ratio (<5%): (Asset-Light or Mature Business)

- Suggests low reinvestment needs, often seen in asset-light industries like technology or services.
- Could also indicate underinvestment if the ratio is consistently low for capital-intensive businesses.

- Evaluates the company’s reinvestment rate into its operations and infrastructure.
- Highlights the company’s growth and maintenance strategy relative to its revenue base.

- Reinvestment Strategy: 
	A higher ratio indicates a focus on growth or maintaining a competitive edge through asset improvements or capacity expansion.
	A lower ratio may reflect an efficient asset base or potential underinvestment in infrastructure.
- Industry Dependence: 
	Capital-intensive industries (e.g., energy, utilities) naturally have higher ratios due to ongoing asset requirements.
	Asset-light industries (e.g., software, retail) typically have lower ratios.
- Growth vs. Maintenance:
	Companies in the growth stage often exhibit higher CapEx-to-Revenue ratios.
	Mature companies may have lower ratios, focusing more on maintaining existing assets.

Advantages:
- Investment Indicator: Highlights the company’s focus on asset maintenance and expansion relative to its revenue generation.
- Cross-Industry Comparability: Useful for comparing reinvestment rates within the same industry.
- Growth vs. Efficiency: Indicates whether the company prioritizes growth through CapEx or focuses on efficiency with minimal reinvestment.

Limitations:
- Excludes Asset Efficiency: Doesn’t reflect how effectively CapEx translates into revenue or profit. (Combine with Asset Turnover or ROA.)
- Short-Term Variability: CapEx can vary significantly year-to-year due to project cycles, making long-term trends more meaningful.
- Industry Variations: Ratios vary widely across industries, limiting cross-sector comparability.

Key Takeaway:
- CapEx / Total Revenue measures the proportion of revenue reinvested into capital expenditures, reflecting the company’s focus on growth and infrastructure.
- A higher ratio (>10%) is typical for capital-intensive industries, while a lower ratio (<5%) is common in asset-light or mature businesses.
- Combine this metric with profitability and efficiency ratios for a comprehensive financial assessment.
