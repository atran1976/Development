Description:
- The OCF/CapEx Ratio measures a company’s ability to finance capital expenditures (CapEx) using its operating cash flow (OCF). 
- It evaluates whether a company generates sufficient cash from operations to maintain and expand its fixed asset base without relying on external financing (debt or equity).
- (Also known as the Cash Flow Coverage Ratio or CapEx Coverage Ratio)

Formula:
- OCF/CapEx Ratio = OCF / CapEx

Interpretation:
- OCF/CapEx Ratio = 400 / 200 = 2.0
- The company generates $2.00 in cash flow for every $1.00 spent on CapEx.

Key Insights:
- High Ratio (> 1.5): (Self-Sufficient Growth): The company generates ample cash flow to fund CapEx without relying on debt or equity financing. Indicates strong cash flow management and growth potential.
- Moderate Ratio (1.0–1.5): (Sustainable Investment): The company covers CapEx with operating cash flow, but may need external funding for expansion projects. Suitable for stable industries with moderate reinvestment needs.
- Low Ratio (< 1.0): (Financing Required): The company does not generate enough cash to cover CapEx, suggesting reliance on debt, equity, or asset sales for investments. Common in growth-focused or capital-intensive sectors.
- Negative Ratio (< 0): (Cash Flow Deficit): Operating cash flow is negative, highlighting cash flow problems or operational inefficiencies.

- Growth Sustainability: High ratios indicate the company can fund expansion internally, reducing reliance on external debt financing.
- Liquidity Planning: Low ratios may signal cash flow constraints, requiring financing or asset sales to support operations.
- Debt Dependency Risks: Ratios below 1.0 highlight debt risks if investments cannot be financed through internal cash flow.
- Capital Intensity Assessment: Asset-heavy industries (e.g., utilities, energy) naturally show lower ratios due to large CapEx needs.

Advantages:
- Cash-Flow Focused: Evaluates cash availability, offering a realistic assessment compared to earnings-based metrics.
- Debt-Free Growth Indicator: Highlights whether the company can expand without borrowing, reducing leverage risks.
- Investment Planning Tool: Tracks whether CapEx is sustainable or requires external financing.

Limitations:
- Ignores Debt Structure: Doesn’t distinguish between debt-funded CapEx and equity-funded investments. (Combine with leverage ratios.)
- Industry Variability: Capital-intensive sectors naturally have lower ratios, requiring peer group comparisons. (Not suitable for cross-sector analysis.)
- Short-Term Focus: Reflects current cash flow, ignoring future growth potential or long-term obligations. (Combine with ROIC.)
- CapEx Classification Issues: May misclassify maintenance CapEx as growth CapEx, distorting analysis. (Analyze CapEx breakdown if available.)

Key Takeaway:
- The OCF/CapEx Ratio evaluates whether a company can self-fund capital expenditures using operating cash flow, offering insights into growth sustainability and financial health.
- Combine it with Free Cash Flow, Debt Ratios, and Profitability Metrics for a comprehensive capital analysis.
